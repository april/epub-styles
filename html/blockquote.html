    <h1>Blockquote</h1>
    <p>Although many readers support <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> as an element, it often doesn’t have a particularly attractive aesthetic.</p>
    <blockquote>For example, this is a blockquote using your platform’s native styling for the blockquote element. Is it attractive to you? If so, by all means use it.</blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes you want a little more pizazz though, don't you?</p>
    <div class="blockquote">
      <p>This is a blockquote with a vertical line on the left side. For many people, it helps distinguish it from an indented paragraph.</p>
      <p>Of course, you can style it however you want, even make it the default style for all blockquotes if you're so inclined. The world is your oyster!</p>
      <div class="attribution">—Anatole France</div>
    </div>
