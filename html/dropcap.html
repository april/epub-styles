    <h1>Dropcap</h1>
    <p class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his page demonstrates the use of drop caps, also known as an <b>initial</b>. In a written or published work, an <b>initial</b> is a letter at the beginning of a word, a chapter, or a paragraph that is larger than the rest of the text. The word is derived from the Latin “<i>initiālis,</i>” which means <i>of the beginning.</i></p>
    <p>Ideally this solution would use the CSS selector <code>::first-letter</code>, but unfortunately this is not supported by Play Books. As such, the first letter of the paragraph of first paragraph of each chapter must be wrapped in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.</p>
