    <h1>Redacted Text</h1>
    <p>This page demonstrates redacted text.<p>
    <p>This text has been <span class="redacted">&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;</span>, so that unauthorized readers can't read it.</p>
    <p>It uses <code>&amp;marker</code>; for each individual character. For readers that support a customized version of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Redacted">Redacted</a> as a font, it will look like one contiguous box.</p>
    <p>Readers that don't support Redacted should, in theory, fall back to a series of black rectangular boxes that looks like &marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;&marker;.</p>
