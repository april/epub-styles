  <h1>Text Messages</h1>
    <p>Text messages are a surprisingly common part of modern fiction, and have dozens of ways to format them. And yet, most of them are entirely unreadable.</p>

    <p>This style features a bunch of unique features, including:
      <ul>
        <li>optional sender and recipient names</li>
        <li>consecutive messages from the same person are closer together than messages from alternating people</li>
        <li>full color on devices that can support it</li>
        <li>messages that won't render partially on one page and partially on another</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p style="page-break-after: always;">Turn to the next page to see what it looks like.</p>
